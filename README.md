# MAT_LAB Malware Analysis Tool

## Project Description
The MAT_LAB Malware Analysis Tool is a Python-based application designed to analyze uploaded files and detect malicious content efficiently. This tool ensures a secure and intuitive user experience, combining Python's powerful libraries with a responsive interface.

This project was developed as a college minor project by a team of five developers, demonstrating expertise in Python, Flask, and data analysis. The source code is shared for learning, collaboration, and further improvement.

## Features

### Malware Detection
- Scans uploaded files for potential malicious content
- Uses advanced algorithms to detect and classify threats

### Secure File Handling
- Filters and validates uploaded files to prevent harmful operations
- Supports various file formats for analysis

### Comprehensive Reporting
- Generates detailed analysis reports for every file scanned
- Displays threat-level results and recommendations to users

### Lightweight and Responsive
